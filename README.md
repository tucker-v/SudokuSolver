# SudokuSolver

This code will solve a traditional 9 x 9 sudoku grid. To run this code, simply input each row with no spaces.
If the slot is empty, input a 0. The program will then use recursion and backtracking to test the values to see if they make a valid grid. When done, the program will print out a display of the completed grid. If it is impossible, a message will be printed signalling so.

I followed a tutorial for this, but I always struggled with the idea of recursion and backtracking, so this defintely helped me understand the idea of why we need recursion in certain instances and an efficient way of backtracking. I did add a way for users to input a grid and did my printing method on my own.

TO DO LIST:
Potentially use JFrame and turn it into an actual game by comparing user inputs to the completed version calculated by the program?
